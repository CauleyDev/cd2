<h2 class="pb-2">My Story</h2>

<br>

<p class="para px-5">Ever since I was very young, trying to use scripts to edit flash games on my laptop, I've always thought coding was the coolest thing in the world. I've always had a flair for anything technical, throughout my life I've spent many thousands of hours exploring the hardware and software aspects of computers. I was on track for an IT career until an impulsive decision led me to pursue a career in my other passion, tattooing..</p>

<p class="para px-5">Through 2 years of cleaning up after (and making many cups of tea for) the tattoo artists in my local studio, I earned the right to learn how to tattoo. After passing my exam and getting my license, 2 more years later I was creating tattoos to be proud of, but living in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere, the work wasn't steady. It was fun and this was fine until I met my amazing girlfriend, Paige! I'm at a point in my life where I need to invest myself wholely into a career so we can build a home and a family together. The only career choice that makes sense to me, and what I know I'll enjoy doing forever, is programming. This is due to my love for tech, creating things, problem solving and always learning new things. A career in development ticks every single box.</p>

<p class="para px-5">Thank you for taking the time to read my story, below are a few tattoos I completed during my time as a tattooist, I added these for 2 reasons, to show off my artistic competency which would pertain to front-end, and also to implement a smooth zoom-on-hover effect which shows some CSS knowledge. Try it!</p>
